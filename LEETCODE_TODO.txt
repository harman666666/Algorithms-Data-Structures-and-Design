PLEASE LOOK AT 652. Find Duplicate Subtrees, and find/analyse discussion by stefan and other mans



Record knowledge for 88. Merge Sorted Array



PLEASE TAKE NOTES ON THE SOLUTIONS OF find median from datastream. 



TAKES NOTES ON 73.  SET MATRIX ZEROS. 



For generate parenthesis can you do DP? GET NOTES FOR THIS. 





RESAARCH RESULTS FOR 33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array 
        
        -> write notes on how you got the solution!
        Wrote down the rules.
        Write down the big rules that satisfy the world constraints
        then write down the local constraints for that world
        the way you write the if statements matters!
        An if statement should seperate worlds aka 
        the sorted world vs unsorted pivot world

        -> Also try DOING a circular array using mod! and finding the pivot!
        -> getting key things like the pivot make the problem easier!
        soemtimes easier to break the problem up and do it that way. 

COMPLETED 105. Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal
    REVIEW IT, -> IMPROVE IT  -> MAKE FASTER -> LOOK AT DISCUSSION 
    -> MAKE SOME BETTER SOLUTIONS LIKE ITERATIVE ETC, 


Take notes on 978. Longest Turbulent Subarray -> easy task

Take quick notes on 1458. Max Dot Product of 2 subsequences in algo readme / how to write clean dp solns.
