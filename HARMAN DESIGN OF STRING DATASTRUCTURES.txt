    Tries
    Tries are some kind of rooted trees in which each edge has a character on it. 
    Actually, trie is some kind of DFA (Determining Finite Automata). For a bunch of 
    strings, their trie is the smallest rooted tree with a character on each edge and 
    each of these strings can be build by writing down the characters in the path 
    from the root to some node.

    It's advantage is, LCP (Longest Common Prefix) of two of these strings is the 
    LCA (Lowest Common Ancestor) of their nodes in the trie(a node that we can 
    build the string by writing down the characters in the 
    path from the root to that node).

    Generating the trie :

    Root is vertex number 0 (C++)

    int x[MAX_NUMBER_OF_NODES][MAX_ASCII_CODE], next = 1; //initially all numbers in x are -1
    void build(string s){
        int i = 0, v = 0;
        while(i < s.size()){
            if(x[v][s[i]] == -1)
                v = x[v][s[i++]] = next ++;
            else
                v = x[v][s[i++]];
        }
    }

    let f be the matrix representation of your trie

    let f[k] be the list of links for the k-th node (NOT ASCII LETTER NODE niggaaHHH)

    let f[k][x] = m, the node who represents the son of k-th node 
        using x-th character, m = -1 is there is not a link.

    int MAX = Max number of nodes
    int CHARSET = alphabet size
    int ROOT = 0
    int sz = 1;

    f[MAX][CHARSET]

    void init() {
    fill(f, -1);
    }

    void insert(char [] s) {
    int node = ROOT;
    for (int i = 0; i < size(s); i++) {
    if ( f[node][ s[i] ] == -1 )
        f[node][ s[i] ] = sz++;
    node = f[node][ s[i] ];
    }
    }

    Notes: Root node is at f[0] sz is the numbers of nodes currently in trie

    I guess would be easy to you implement other functions.

    what about ababc?
    abbc 

    a -> b -> a -> b ->
        -> b

Trie Implementation

This data structure is pretty useful for storing large databases of words. 
It provides linear time search and linear time insertion into the pool of words.

class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = {}
        self.leaf = False
        
class Trie(object):
 
    def __init__(self):
        """
        Initialize your data structure here.
        """
        self.root = TrieNode()
         
 
    def insert(self, word):
        """
        Inserts a word into the trie.
        :type word: str
        :rtype: void
        """
        root = self.root
        for c in word:
            if c not in root.children:
                root.children[c] = TrieNode()
            root = root.children[c]
        root.leaf = True

    def search(self, word):
        """
        Returns if the word is in the trie.

        for c in word:
            if c not in root.children:

            root = root.children[c]
        return root.leaf
         
 
    def startsWith(self, prefix):
        """
        Returns if there is any word in the trie that starts with the given prefix.
        :type prefix: str
        :rtype: bool

        root = self.root
        for c in prefix:
            if c not in root.children:
                return False
            root = root.children[c]

    TRIES LEETCODE REVIEW

        https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/4161389/All-you-need-to-know-about-trie


        A trie, also known as a prefix tree, is a tree-like data structure used to store a dynamic set of strings where the keys are usually strings. It is particularly efficient for tasks like prefix searching and string lookups. Here's an overview of tries in C++ with common problems and solutions:

        Trie Structure in C++:

        class TrieNode {
        public:
            TrieNode* children[26]; // Assuming lowercase English alphabet
            bool isEndOfWord;
            TrieNode() {
                for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
                    children[i] = nullptr;
                }
                isEndOfWord = false;
            }
        };

        class Trie {
        public:
            TrieNode* root;
            Trie() {
                root = new TrieNode();
            }
            // Methods for insertion, search, and other operations.
        };
        Common Problems and Solutions with Tries:

        Insertion into a Trie:

        Problem: Given a set of strings, insert them into a trie.
        Solution: Implement a function to traverse the trie, creating nodes for characters as needed 
        and marking the last character as the end of a word.

        Search in a Trie:

        Problem: Given a string, check if it exists in the trie.
        Solution: Traverse the trie, checking for each character's presence and the final node's 'isEndOfWord' flag.
        Auto-completion / Prefix Searching:

        Problem: Given a prefix, find all words in the trie that start with the prefix.
        Solution: Traverse the trie to the node representing the prefix and perform a depth-first search to collect words under that node.
        Longest Common Prefix:

        Problem: Given an array of strings, find the longest common prefix.
        Solution: Traverse the trie to find the common prefix up to the first differing character in the first and last strings.
        
        Count Words with a Given Prefix:

        Problem: Count the number of words in a trie with a given prefix.
        Solution: Traverse the trie to the node representing the prefix and count all the words under that node.
        
        Deleting a String from a Trie:

        Problem: Given a string, delete it from the trie.
        Solution: Traverse the trie to the node representing the string, set the 'isEndOfWord' flag to false, 
        and optionally remove nodes if they have no other children.


        Solving Word Search Problems:

        Problem: Given a 2D board of characters and a list of words, find all the words from the list in the board.
        Solution: Use a trie to efficiently search for words in the board by backtracking and avoiding unnecessary exploration.
        
        
        Implementing a Spell Checker:

        Problem: Create a spell checker that can suggest correct spellings for a misspelled word.
        Solution: Build a trie containing a dictionary of correctly spelled words and use it to suggest corrections for misspelled words.
        
        
        1. Insertion into a Trie:

        class TrieNode {
        public:
            TrieNode* children[26]; // Assuming lowercase English alphabet
            bool isEndOfWord;
            TrieNode() {
                for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
                    children[i] = nullptr;
                }
                isEndOfWord = false;
            }
        };

        class Trie {
        public:
            TrieNode* root;
            Trie() {
                root = new TrieNode();
            }

            void insert(string word) {
                TrieNode* current = root;
                for (char ch : word) {
                    int index = ch - 'a';
                    if (!current->children[index]) {
                        current->children[index] = new TrieNode();
                    }
                    current = current->children[index];
                }
                current->isEndOfWord = true;
            }
        };

        2. Searching in a Trie:

        bool search(TrieNode* root, string word) {
            TrieNode* current = root;
            for (char ch : word) {
                int index = ch - 'a';
                if (!current->children[index]) {
                    return false;
                }
                current = current->children[index];
            }
            return current->isEndOfWord;
        }

        3. Auto-completion / Prefix Searching:

        void findAllWordsWithPrefix(TrieNode* root, string prefix, vector<string>& result) {
            TrieNode* current = root;
            for (char ch : prefix) {
                int index = ch - 'a';
                if (!current->children[index]) {
                    return; // Prefix not found
                }
                current = current->children[index];
            }
            // Perform a depth-first search to collect words under this node.
            findAllWordsFromNode(current, prefix, result);
        }

        void findAllWordsFromNode(TrieNode* node, string currentWord, vector<string>& result) {
            if (node->isEndOfWord) {
                result.push_back(currentWord);
            }
            for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
                if (node->children[i]) {
                    char ch = 'a' + i;
                    findAllWordsFromNode(node->children[i], currentWord + ch, result);
                }
            }
        }


        4. Deleting a String from a Trie:

        bool deleteWord(TrieNode* root, string word, int index) {
            if (index == word.length()) {
                if (!root->isEndOfWord) return false; // Word doesn't exist
                root->isEndOfWord = false;
                return isEmptyNode(root);
            }
            int chIndex = word[index] - 'a';
            if (!root->children[chIndex]) return false; // Word doesn't exist
            bool canDelete = deleteWord(root->children[chIndex], word, index + 1);
            if (canDelete) {
                delete root->children[chIndex];
                root->children[chIndex] = nullptr;
                return isEmptyNode(root);
            }
            return false;
        }

        bool isEmptyNode(TrieNode* node) {
            for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
                if (node->children[i]) return false;
            }
            return true;
        }


        These code snippets cover basic operations with a trie, including insertion, searching, auto-completion with a given prefix, 
        and deletion of words. You can use these as a starting point and adapt them to your specific requirements
         when working with trie data structures in C++.

        What about Compresed Trie?

        Compressed tries are a space-efficient variation of standard tries that reduce memory consumption by merging nodes with a single child into a single node. They are particularly useful for cases where the trie may have a large number of nodes with only one child, which can lead to significant memory savings.

        Compressed Trie Structure in C++:

        #include <iostream>
        #include <unordered_map>
        #include <string>

        class CompressedTrieNode {
        public:
            std::unordered_map<char, CompressedTrieNode*> children;
            bool isEndOfWord;

            CompressedTrieNode() : isEndOfWord(false) {}
        };

        class CompressedTrie {
        public:
            CompressedTrieNode* root;

            CompressedTrie() {
                root = new CompressedTrieNode();
            }

            void insert(const std::string& word) {
                CompressedTrieNode* current = root;
                for (char ch : word) {
                    if (current->children.find(ch) == current->children.end()) {
                        current->children[ch] = new CompressedTrieNode();
                    }
                    current = current->children[ch];
                }
                current->isEndOfWord = true;
            }

            bool search(const std::string& word) {
                CompressedTrieNode* current = root;
                for (char ch : word) {
                    if (current->children.find(ch) == current->children.end()) {
                        return false;
                    }
                    current = current->children[ch];
                }
                return current->isEndOfWord;
            }
        };

        int main() {
            CompressedTrie trie;
            
            trie.insert("apple");
            trie.insert("app");
            trie.insert("banana");
            
            std::cout << "Search 'apple': " << (trie.search("apple") ? "Found" : "Not found") << std::endl;
            std::cout << "Search 'app': " << (trie.search("app") ? "Found" : "Not found") << std::endl;
            std::cout << "Search 'banana': " << (trie.search("banana") ? "Found" : "Not found") << std::endl;
            std::cout << "Search 'orange': " << (trie.search("orange") ? "Found" : "Not found") << std::endl;

            return 0;
        }
        Compressed Trie Output:

        Search 'apple': Found
        Search 'app': Found
        Search 'banana': Found
        Search 'orange': Not found
        A baic comparison between Standard Trie and Compressed Trie:

        Standard Trie:

        In a standard trie, each node represents a single character of a string. Nodes are connected by edges labeled with characters. It's a straightforward structure that may not be very memory-efficient, especially when there are many nodes with only one child.

                (root)
                /  |  |  \
                a   b  c   d
            /   / \    / \
            p   a   t  o   r
            /   /     \   \   \
            p   n       e   n   y
        /   /         \   \   \
        l   a           r   e   a
        Compressed Trie:

        In a compressed trie, nodes with a single child are merged into a single node. This results in a more memory-efficient structure, especially when there are long sequences of characters shared by multiple words.

                    (root)
                /  |   |   |   \
                ab   c   d   e   ar
                |    |   |       |
                pap  t   o       eny
                / \   \       /
                l   a   r     e
        In the compressed trie, the sequence "ap" is shared by "apple" and "app," so it's represented as a single node. Similarly, "en" is shared by "pen" and "penny," so it's compressed into one node. This compression can significantly reduce memory usage in scenarios where there is redundancy in the structure of the tree.

        Overall, while both tries represent the same set of words, the compressed trie is more memory-efficient. However, building and searching in a compressed trie can be a bit more complex compared to a standard trie due to the compression and decompression processes.

        Suffix Tries and Suffix Trees

        Suffix tries and suffix trees are advanced data structures used in string processing and pattern matching.
        They are used to efficiently search for and manipulate substrings within a larger string. Suffix trees are 
        losely related to suffix tries and are a more space-efficient representation of the same information.

        1. Suffix Trie:

        A suffix trie is a tree-like data structure that represents all the suffixes of a given string. 
        Each path from the root to a leaf node represents a suffix of the string. Suffix tries contain all substrings, 
        and they are constructed by adding one character at a time from the original string.

        Suffix trie for the string x = atatgtttgt$.

        image

        Here's a simple example of a suffix trie for the string "banana" with some suffixes:

                            ┌──┐
                        ┌─── b └── n ─┐
                    ┌─── a ─┐           └── a
                ┌─── n ─┐    └─── a
            ┌─── a ─┐    └── n
        ┌─── n ─┐     └── a
        ┌── a ─┐     └── n
        │  a  │     └── a
        │  n  │
        └─────┘
        2. Suffix Tree:

        A suffix tree is a more space-efficient representation of a suffix trie. It 
        eliminates redundant information and compresses the trie structure, making it more practical for real-world use.

        Applications:

        Suffix trees and suffix tries are used in various applications, including:

        Substring Searching: They can be used to search for substrings efficiently. 
        For example, in text editors, you can quickly find occurrences of a word within a large document.

        Pattern Matching: Suffix trees are widely used in bioinformatics for sequence alignment and pattern matching in DNA and protein sequences.

        Longest Common Substring: They can be used to find the longest common substring between two or more strings.

        Data Compression: Suffix trees are used in data compression algorithms like Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) and Run-Length Encoding (RLE).

        Text Indexing: Search engines and database systems use suffix trees for text indexing and searching.

        Creating a Suffix Tree in C++:

        Creating a suffix tree is complex and typically requires specialized algorithms such as Ukkonen's algorithm. 
        Here's a simple example of how to build a suffix tree in C++ using a library like libstree:

        #include <libstree/suffix_tree.h>

        int main() {
            struct suffix_tree* st = st_create();

            const char* text = "banana";
            st_add_string(st, text);

            st_free(st); // Don't forget to free the tree when done
            return 0;
        }

        Visualizing a Suffix Tree:

        You can visualize a suffix tree using a tool like Graphviz:

        #include <libstree/suffix_tree.h>
        #include <libstree/streeviz.h>

        int main() {
            struct suffix_tree* st = st_create();

            const char* text = "banana";
            st_add_string(st, text);

            streeviz(st, "suffix_tree.dot"); // Visualize the tree
            st_free(st); // Don't forget to free the tree when done
            return 0;
        }

        Multi-Key Trie

        A multi-key trie is a trie that stores multiple keys in a single trie. It's a space-efficient data structure that can be used to store a set of strings where the keys are usually strings. It's particularly useful for tasks like prefix searching and string lookups.

        Multi-Key Trie Structure in C++:

        Radix Tree or Patricia Trie:

        Radix trees, also known as radix tries or compact prefix trees, are a space-efficient variation of the traditional trie data structure. They are designed to store and efficiently search strings with common prefixes. Radix trees compress the trie structure by collapsing linear chains of nodes into a single node, reducing memory consumption and improving lookup performance. They are commonly used in networking, file systems, and IP address storage.

        A popular problems solving using radix tree is IP Address Lookup:

        IP Address Lookup

        IP address lookup is a common problem in networking and routing. It involves searching for the longest prefix match of an 
        IP address in a routing table. Radix trees are a popular data structure for this problem because they can efficiently store and search IP addresses.

        Trie vs. Hash Table

        Tries and hash tables are two popular data structures used to store and search for data. They are both efficient for searching, but they have different characteristics that make them suitable for different use cases.

        Trie:

        A trie is a tree-like data structure that stores data in a tree structure. It's particularly useful for storing strings and performing prefix searches. Tries are efficient for searching and inserting strings, but they can be slower than hash tables for other types of data.

        Hash Table:

        A hash table is a data structure that stores data in an array. It's particularly useful for storing and searching for data with unique keys. Hash tables are efficient for searching and inserting data, but they can be slower than tries for strings.

        Some Popular Problems:

        Longest Common Prefix:

        Problem: Given an array of strings, find the longest common prefix.
        Solution: Use a trie to find the common prefix up to the first differing character in the first and last strings.
        Count Words with a Given Prefix:

        Problem: Count the number of words in a trie with a given prefix.
        Solution: Traverse the trie to the node representing the prefix and count all the words under that node.
        Solving Word Search Problems:

        Problem: Given a 2D board of characters and a list of words, find all the words from the list in the board.
        Solution: Use a trie to efficiently search for words in the board by backtracking and avoiding unnecessary exploration.
        Implementing a Spell Checker:

        Problem: Create a spell checker that can suggest correct spellings for a misspelled word.
        Solution: Build a trie containing a dictionary of correctly spelled words and use it to suggest corrections for misspelled words.
        IP Address Lookup:

        Problem: Given a list of IP addresses, find all the IP addresses with a common prefix.
        Solution: Use a radix tree to efficiently store and search for IP addresses with common prefixes.
        Auto-completion / Prefix Searching:

        Problem: Given a prefix, find all words in the trie that start with the prefix.
        Solution: Traverse the trie to the node representing the prefix and perform a depth-first search to collect words under that node.
        Deleting a String from a Trie:

        Problem: Given a string, delete it from the trie.
        Solution: Traverse the trie to the node representing the string, set the 'isEndOfWord' flag to false, and optionally remove nodes if they have no other children.
        Insertion into a Trie:

        Problem: Given a set of strings, insert them into a trie.
        Solution: Implement a function to traverse the trie, creating nodes for characters as needed and marking the last character as the end of a word.
        Search in a Trie:

        Problem: Given a string, check if it exists in the trie.
        Solution: Traverse the trie, checking for each character's presence and the final node's 'isEndOfWord' flag.
        Compressed Trie:

        Problem: Given a set of strings, insert them into a compressed trie.
        Solution: Implement a function to traverse the trie, creating nodes for characters as needed and marking the last character as the end of a word. Merge nodes with a single child into a single node to compress the trie.

SUFFIX ARRAYS:
    In computer science, the longest common prefix array (LCP array) is an auxiliary 
    data structure to the suffix array. It stores the lengths of the longest common 
    prefixes (LCPs) between all pairs of consecutive suffixes in a sorted suffix array.

    For example, if A := [aab, ab, abaab, b, baab] is a suffix array, the longest 
    common prefix between A[1] = aab and A[2] = ab is a which has length 1, so H[2] = 1 
    in the LCP array H. Likewise, the LCP of A[2] = ab and A[3] = abaab is ab, so H[3] = 2.

    Augmenting the suffix array with the LCP array allows one to efficiently 
    simulate top-down and bottom-up traversals of the suffix tree,[1][2] 
    speeds up pattern matching on the suffix array[3] and is a 
    prerequisite for compressed suffix trees.






    Suffix array
    Suffix array is a data structure that helps you sort 
    all the suffixes in lexicography order.

    This array consists of integers, the beginning of suffixes.

    There are two ways to achieve this goal :

    One) Non-deterministic algorithm : Use Robin-Carp and for check if a suffix 
    is lexicographically less than another one, find their LCP using 
    binary search + hash and then check the next character after their LCP.

    Code :

    namespace HashSuffixArray
    {
        const int
            MAXN = 1 << 21;

        typedef unsigned long long hash;

        const hash BASE = 137;

        int N;
        char * S;
        int sa[MAXN];
        hash h[MAXN], hPow[MAXN];

        #define getHash(lo, size) (h[lo] - h[(lo) + (size)] * hPow[size])

        inline bool sufCmp(int i, int j)
        {
            int lo = 1, hi = min(N - i, N - j);
            while (lo <= hi)
            {
                int mid = (lo + hi) >> 1;
                if (getHash(i, mid) == getHash(j, mid))
                    lo = mid + 1;
                else
                    hi = mid - 1;
            }
            return S[i + hi] < S[j + hi];
        }

        void buildSA()
        {
            N = strlen(S);
            hPow[0] = 1;
            for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i)
                hPow[i] = hPow[i - 1] * BASE;
            h[N] = 0;
            for (int i = N - 1; i >= 0; --i)
                h[i] = h[i + 1] * BASE + S[i], sa[i] = i;

            stable_sort(sa, sa + N, sufCmp);
        }

    } // end namespace HashSuffixArray


    Two) Deterministic algorithm : We sort them log(MaxLength) steps, in the 
    i - th step (counting from 0), we sort them according to their first 2i 
    characters and put the suffixes whit the same prefix with 2i characters in the same buckets.

    Code :

    /*
    Suffix array O(n lg^2 n)
    LCP table O(n)
    */
    #include <cstdio>
    #include <algorithm>
    #include <cstring>

    using namespace std;

    #define REP(i, n) for (int i = 0; i < (int)(n); ++i)

    namespace SuffixArray
    {
        const int MAXN = 1 << 21;
        char * S;
        int N, gap;
        int sa[MAXN], pos[MAXN], tmp[MAXN], lcp[MAXN];

        bool sufCmp(int i, int j)
        {
            if (pos[i] != pos[j])
                return pos[i] < pos[j];
            i += gap;
            j += gap;
            return (i < N && j < N) ? pos[i] < pos[j] : i > j;
        }

        void buildSA()
        {
            N = strlen(S);
            REP(i, N) sa[i] = i, pos[i] = S[i];
            for (gap = 1;; gap *= 2)
            {
                sort(sa, sa + N, sufCmp);
                REP(i, N - 1) tmp[i + 1] = tmp[i] + sufCmp(sa[i], sa[i + 1]);
                REP(i, N) pos[sa[i]] = tmp[i];
                if (tmp[N - 1] == N - 1) break;
            }
        }

        void buildLCP()
        {
            for (int i = 0, k = 0; i < N; ++i) if (pos[i] != N - 1)
            {
                for (int j = sa[pos[i] + 1]; S[i + k] == S[j + k];)
                ++k;
                lcp[pos[i]] = k;
                if (k)--k;
            }
        }

COMPRESSED TRIES (PATRICIA TRIES)

Compressed Tries (Patricia Tries)
Patricia: Practical Algorithm To Retrieve Information Coded in
Alphanumeric
Introduced by Morrison (1968)
Reduces storage requirement: eliminate unflagged nodes with only
one child
Every path of one-child unflagged nodes is compressed to a single
edge
Each node stores an index indicating the next bit to be tested during
a search (index= 0 for the first bit, index= 1 for the second bit, etc)
A compressed trie storing n keys always has at most n − 1 internal
(non-leaf) node

Each node stores an index indicating the next bit to be tested during
a search (Look at CS240 note for visualization) AND a key, which is the completed word for that node 
from the dictionary of words the trie is generated from 


Search(x):
    Follow the proper path from the root down in the tree to a leaf
    If search ends in an unflagged node, it is unsuccessful
    If search ends in a flagged node, we need to check if the key stored is
    indeed x (because we are skipping checks, and checking random indexes, so we store 
    in each node of the trie, the complete word for that leaf.)

Delete(x):
    Perform Search(x)
    if search ends in an internal node, then
        if the node has two children, then unflag the node and delete the key
        else delete the node and make his only child, the child of its parent
    if search ends in a leaf, then delete the leaf and
    if its parent is unflagged, then delete the parent

Insert(x):
    Perform Search(x)
    -> If the search ends at a leaf L with key y , compare x against y .
    ->If y is a prefix of x, add a child to y containing x.
    ->Else, determine the first index i where they disagree and create a new
        node N with index i.
        Insert N along the path from the root to L so that the parent of N has
        index < i and one child of N is either L or an existing node on the path
        from the root to L that has index > i.
        The other child of N will be a new leaf node containing x.
    ->If the search ends at an internal node, we find the key corresponding to
    that internal node and proceed in a similar way to the previous case.

STRING SEARCH ALGORITHMS:
        KMP string searching
        Manacher’s Algorithm
        Aho–Corasick string matching algorithm;
        Z ALGORITHM

###########################################################################
#############################################################################

Here are some typical thoughts on search types:

Boyer-Moore: works by pre-analyzing the pattern and comparing from right-to-left. 
If a mismatch occurs, the initial analysis is used to determine how far the pattern can 
be shifted w.r.t. the text being searched. This works particularly well for long search 
patterns. In particular, it can be sub-linear, as you do not need to read 
every single character of your text.

Knuth-Morris-Pratt: also pre-analyzes the pattern, but tries to re-use whatever 
was already matched in the initial part of the pattern to avoid having to rematch that. 
This can work quite well, if your alphabet is small (f.ex. DNA bases), as you get a 
higher chance that your search patterns contain reuseable subpatterns.

Aho-Corasick: Needs a lot of preprocessing, but does so for a number of patterns. 
If you know you will be looking for the same search patterns over and over again, 
then this is much better than the other, because you need to 
analyse patterns only once, not once per search.

Space Usage favors Rabin-Karp
One major advantage of Rabin-Karp is that it uses O(1) auxiliary storage space, 
which is great if the pattern string you're looking for is very large. 
For example, if you're looking for all occurrences of a string of length 107 
in a longer string of length 109, not having to allocate a table of 107 
machine words for a failure function or shift table is a major win. 
Both Boyer-Moore and KMP use Ω(n) memory on a pattern string of 
length n, so Rabin-Karp would be a clear win here.

Worst-Case Single-Match Efficiency Favors Boyer-Moore or KMP
Rabin-Karp suffers from two potential worst cases. First, 
if the particular prime numbers used by Rabin-Karp are 
known to a malicious adversary, that adversary could
potentially craft an input that causes the rolling hash to match the 
hash of a pattern string at each point in time, causing the algorithm's 
performance to degrade to Ω((m - n + 1)n) on a string of length m and 
pattern of length n. If you're taking untrusted strings as input, this 
could potentially be an issue. Neither Boyer-Moore 
nor KMP have these weaknesses.

Worst-Case Multiple-Match Efficiency favors KMP.
Similarly, Rabin-Karp is slow in the case where you want to find all matches of a 
pattern string in the case where that pattern appears a large number of times. 
For example, if you're looking for a string of 105 copies of the letter a 
in text string consisting of 109copies of the letter a with Rabin-Karp, 
then there will be lots of spots where the pattern string appears, 
and each will require a linear scan. This can also lead 
to a runtime of Ω((m + n - 1)n).

Many Boyer-Moore implementations suffer from this second rule, but will not 
have bad runtimes in the first case. 
And KMP has no pathological worst-cases like these.

Best-Case Performance favors Boyer-Moore
One advantage of the Boyer-Moore algorithm is that it doesn't necessarily 
have to scan all the characters of the input string. Specifically, 
the Bad Character Rule can be used to skip over huge regions of 
the input string in the event of a mismatch. More specifically, 
the best-case runtime for Boyer-Moore is O(m / n), which is much 
faster than what Rabin-Karp or KMP can provide.

Generalizations to Multiple Strings favor KMP
Suppose you have a fixed set of multiple text strings that you want to 
search for, rather than just one. You could, if you wanted to, run multiple passes 
of Rabin-Karp, KMP, or Boyer-Moore across the strings to find all the matches. 
However, the runtime of this approach isn't great, as it scales linearly 
with the number of strings to search for. On the other hand, KMP generalizes 
nicely to the Aho-Corasick string-matching algorithm, which runs in time
O(m + n + z), where z is the number of matches found and n is the 
combined length of the pattern strings. Notice that there's no dependence 
here on the number of different pattern strings being searched for!

#################################################################################
STRING ALGORITHM: RABIN KARP

    Rabin Karp
        So Rabin Karp algorithm needs to calculate 
        hash values for following strings.
        1) Pattern itself.
        2) All the substrings of text of length m.

        Since we need to efficiently calculate hash values for all the substrings 
        of size m of text, we must have a hash function which has following property.
        Hash at the next shift must be efficiently computable from the current hash 
        value and next character in text or we can say hash(txt[s+1 .. s+m]) must 
        be efficiently computable from hash(txt[s .. s+m-1]) and txt[s+m] i.e., 
        hash(txt[s+1 .. s+m])= rehash(txt[s+m], hash(txt[s .. s+m-1])) and rehash must be O(1) operation.
        
        To do rehashing, we need to take off the most significant digit
        and add the new least significant digit for in hash value. 
        Rehashing is done using the following formula.
        
        prevHash = hash( txt[s .. s+m-1])
        hash( txt[s+1 .. s+m] ) = ( d * ( prevHash – txt[s]*h ) + txt[s + m] ) mod q

        hash( txt[s .. s+m-1] ) : Hash value at shift s.
        hash( txt[s+1 .. s+m] ) : Hash value at next shift (or shift s+1)
        d: Number of characters in the alphabet
        q: A prime number
        h: d^(m-1)

        How does above expression work?
        This is simple mathematics, we compute decimal value of current window from previous window.
        For example pattern length is 3 and string is “23456”
        You compute the value of first window (which is “234”) as 234.
        How how will you compute value of next window “345”? You will do (234 – 2*100)*10 + 5 and get 345.

STRING ALGORITHM: FINITE AUTOMATA (Basically KMP)

The basic idea is to build a automaton in which
• Each character in the pattern has a state.
• Each match sends the automaton into a new state.
• If all the characters in the pattern has been
matched, the automaton enters the accepting state.
• Otherwise, the automaton will return to a suitable
state according to the current state and the input
character such that this returned state reflects the
maximum advantage we can take from the
previous matching.
• the matching takes O(n) time since each character
is examined once.



The construction of the stringmatching automaton is based on
the given pattern. The time of this
construction may be O(m3
|S|)

A finite automaton M is a 5-tuple (Q,q0 ,A,S,d),
where
• Q is a finite set of states.
• q0 in Q is the start state.
• A in Q is a distinguish set of accepting states.
• S is a finite input alphabet
• d is a function from Q × S into Q, called the
transition function of M.

Construction of the FA is the main tricky part of this algorithm. 
Once the FA is built, the searching is simple. In search, we simply 
need to start from the first state of the automata and the first 
character of the text. At every step, we consider next character of 
text, look for the next state in the built FA and move to a new state. 
If we reach the final state, then the pattern is found in the text. 
The time complexity of the search process is O(n).

Matching time on a text string of length n is Θ(n)
This does not include the preprocessing time required to compute the
transition function δ. There exists an algorithm with O(m|Σ|)
preprocessing time.
Altogether, we can find all occurrences of a length-m pattern in a
length-n text over a finite alphabet Σ with O(m|Σ|) preprocessing
time and Θ(n) matching time.

STRING ALGORITHM: KMP

Compares the pattern to the text in left-to-right
Shifts the pattern more intelligently than the brute-force algorithm
When a mismatch occurs, how much can we shift the pattern
(reusing knowledge from previous matches)?

KMP Answer: this depends on the largest prefix of P[0..j] that is a
suffix of P[1..j]

Prefix of P[0..j]: starts from index 0 of P and builds to right 
Suffix of P[1..j]: starts from P[j] and grows by building left, and you cant include P[0] (because its P[1..j])

        – Main idea is to skip some comparisons by using the previous
        comparison result
        
        LPS[] that will hold the longest prefix suffix  
        
        Uses an auxiliary array π that is defined as the following:
        – π[i] is the largest integer smaller than i such that P 1 . . . P π[i] is
        a suffix of P 1 . . . P i

        Examples:

        Pattern: a a a a a
        LSP    : 0 1 2 3 4

        Pattern: a b a b a b
        LSP    : 0 0 1 2 3 4

        Pattern: a b a c a b a b
        LSP    : 0 0 1 0 1 2 3 2

        Pattern: a a a b a a a a a b
        LSP    : 0 1 2 0 1 2 3 3 3 4

        txt[] = "AAAAABAAABA" 
        pat[] = "AAAA"
        lps[] = {0, 1, 2, 3} 

        i = 0, j = 0
        txt[] = "AAAAABAAABA" 
        pat[] = "AAAA"
        txt[i] and pat[j] match, do i++, j++

        i = 1, j = 1
        txt[] = "AAAAABAAABA" 
        pat[] = "AAAA"
        txt[i] and pat[j] match, do i++, j++

        i = 2, j = 2
        txt[] = "AAAAABAAABA" 
        pat[] = "AAAA"
        pat[i] and pat[j] match, do i++, j++

        i = 3, j = 3
        txt[] = "AAAAABAAABA" 
        pat[] = "AAAA"
        txt[i] and pat[j] match, do i++, j++

        i = 4, j = 4
        Since j == M, print pattern found and reset j,
        j = lps[j-1] = lps[3] = 3

        Here unlike Naive algorithm, we do not match first three 
        characters of this window. Value of lps[j-1] (in above 
        step) gave us index of next character to match.
        i = 4, j = 3

        Since j == M, print pattern found and reset j,

        Again unlike Naive algorithm, we do not match first three 
        characters of this window. Value of lps[j-1] (in above 
        step) gave us index of next character to match.

        j = lps[j-1] = lps[0] = 0

        i = 5, j = 0
        txt[] = "AAAAABAAABA" 
        pat[] =      "AAAA"
        txt[i] and pat[j] do NOT match and j is 0, we do i++.

        i = 6, j = 0
        txt[] = "AAAAABAAABA"

        txt[i] and pat[j] match, do i++ and j++

STRING ALGORITHM: BOYER MOORE WALKTHROUGH:

PART A:
    Based on three key ideas:
        Reverse-order searching: Compare P with a subsequence of T moving
        backwards

        Bad character jumps: When a mismatch occurs at T [i] = c
            If P contains c, we can shift P to align the last occurrence of c in P
            with T [i]
            Otherwise, we can shift P to align P[0] with T [i + 1]
        
        Good suffix jumps: If we have already matched a suffix of P, then get
            a mismatch, we can shift P forward to align with the previous
            occurence of that suffix (with a mismatch from the suffix we read). If
            none exists, look for the longest prefix of P that is a suffix of what we
            read. Similar to failure array in KMP.

        Can skip large parts of T

    Boyer Moore is a combination of following two approaches.
    1) Bad Character Heuristic
    2) Good Suffix Heuristic

    Both of the above heuristics can also be used independently to search a 
    pattern in a text. Let us first understand how two independent 
    approaches work together in the Boyer Moore algorithm. If we 
    take a look at the Naive algorithm, it slides the pattern over 
    the text one by one. KMP algorithm does preprocessing over the 
    pattern so that the pattern can be shifted by more than one. 
    The Boyer Moore algorithm does preprocessing for the same reason. 
    It processes the pattern and creates different arrays for both 
    heuristics. At every step, it slides the pattern by the max of the 
    slides suggested by the two heuristics. So it uses best 
    of the two heuristics at every step.

    Unlike the previous pattern searching algorithms, Boyer Moore algorithm 
    starts matching from the last character of the pattern.

PART B:
    The insight behind Boyer-Moore is that if you start searching for a 
    pattern in a string starting with the last character in the pattern, 
    you can jump your search forward multiple characters when you hit a mismatch.

    Let's say our pattern p is the sequence of characters 
    p1, p2, ..., pn and we are searching a 
    string s, currently with p aligned so that pn is at index i in s.

    E.g.:

    s = WHICH FINALLY HALTS.  AT THAT POINT...
    p = AT THAT
    i =       ^
    The B-M paper makes the following observations:
    (1) if we try matching a character that is not in p then we can jump forward n characters:

    'F' is not in p, hence we advance n characters:

    s = WHICH FINALLY HALTS.  AT THAT POINT...
    p =        AT THAT
    i =              ^

    (2) if we try matching a character whose last position is 
    k from the end of p then we can jump forward k characters:

    ' 's last position in p is 4 from the end, hence we advance 4 characters:

    s = WHICH FINALLY HALTS.  AT THAT POINT...
    p =            AT THAT
    i =                  ^

    Now we scan backwards from i until we either succeed or we hit a mismatch. 
    (3a) if the mismatch occurs k characters from the start of p and the 
    mismatched character is not in p, then we can advance (at least) k characters.

    'L' is not in p and the mismatch occurred against p6, hence we can advance (at least) 6 characters:

    s = WHICH FINALLY HALTS.  AT THAT POINT...
    p =                  AT THAT
    i =                        ^
    However, we can actually do better than this. (3b) since we know that 
    at the old i we'd already matched some characters (1 in this case). If 
    the matched characters don't match the start of p, then we can actually 
    jump forward a little more (this extra distance is called 'delta2' in the paper):

    s = WHICH FINALLY HALTS.  AT THAT POINT...
    p =                   AT THAT
    i =                         ^
    At this point, observation (2) applies again, giving

    s = WHICH FINALLY HALTS.  AT THAT POINT...
    p =                       AT THAT
    i =                             ^
    and bingo! We're done.

PART C:

    Now that said, the algorithm is based on a simple principle. Suppose that I'm trying 
    to match a substring of length m. I'm going to first look at character at index m.
    If that character is not in my string, I know that the substring 
    I want can't start in characters at indices 1, 2, ... , m.

    If that character is in my string, I'll assume that it is at the last place in my 
    string that it can be. I'll then jump back and start trying to match my string 
    from that possible starting place. This piece of information is my first table.

    Once I start matching from the beginning of the substring, when I find a mismatch, 
    I can't just start from scratch. I could be partially through a match starting 
    at a different point. For instance if I'm trying to match anand in ananand successfully 
    match, anan, realize that the following a is not a d, but I've just matched an, and so 
    I should jump back to trying to match my third character in my substring. This, "If I fail 
    after matching x characters, I could be on the y'th character of a match" 
    information is stored in the second table.

    Note that when I fail to match the second table knows how far along in a match I might 
    be based on what I just matched. The first table knows how far back I might be based 
    on the character that I just saw which I failed to match. You want to use 
    the more pessimistic of those two pieces of information.

    With this in mind the algorithm works like this:

    start at beginning of string
    start at beginning of match
    while not at the end of the string:
        if match_position is 0:
            Jump ahead m characters
            Look at character, jump back based on table 1
            If match the first character:
                advance match position
            advance string position
        else if I match:
            if I reached the end of the match:
            FOUND MATCH - return
            else:
            advance string position and match position.
        else:
            pos1 = table1[ character I failed to match ]
            pos2 = table2[ how far into the match I am ]
            if pos1 < pos2:
                jump back pos1 in string
                set match position at beginning
            else:
                set match position to pos2
    FAILED TO MATCH

STRING ALGORITHM: BOYER Moore BAD CHARACTER HEURISTIC

Boyer-Moore Algorithm

In this post, we will discuss bad character heuristic, 
and discuss Good Suffix heuristic in the next post.

The idea of bad character heuristic is simple. 
The character of the text which doesn’t match with the current 
character of the pattern is called the Bad Character.
Upon mismatch, we shift the pattern until –
1) The mismatch becomes a match
2) Pattern P move past the mismatched character.

Case 1 – Mismatch become match
We will lookup the position of last occurrence of mismatching character 
in pattern and if mismatching character exist in pattern then we’ll shift 
the pattern such that it get aligned to the mismatching character in text T.

Case 2 – Pattern move past the mismatch character
We’ll lookup the position of last occurrence of mismatching character 
in pattern and if character does not exist we will 
shift pattern past the mismatching character.

STRING ALGORITHM: Suffix Tries and Suffix Trees

What if we want to search for many patterns P within the same fixed
text T ?

Idea: Preprocess the text T rather than the pattern P
Observation: P is a substring of T if and only if P is a prefix of some
suffix of T .
We will call a trie that stores all suffixes of a text T a suffix trie, and the
compressed suffix trie of T a suffix tree.

Build the suffix trie, i.e. the trie containing all the suffixes of the text
Build the suffix tree by compressing the trie above (like in Patricia
trees)
Store two indexes l, r on each node v (both internal nodes and
leaves) where node v corresponds to substring T [l..r ]

T = bananaban
SUFFIXES: {bananaban$, ananaban$, nanaban$, anaban$, naban$, aban$, ban$, an$, n$}

Use $ to indicate end of suffixes in trie
CREATE TRIE!
then create compressed trie aka suffix tree (and each node contains 2 indexes l,r )


Suffix Trees: Pattern Matching
    To search for pattern P of length m:
    Similar to Search in compressed trie with the difference that we are
    looking for a prefix match rather than a complete match
    If we reach a leaf with a corresponding string length less than m, then
    search is unsuccessful
    Otherwise, we reach a node v (leaf or internal) with a corresponding
    string length of at least m
    It only suffices to check the first m characters against the substring of
    the text between indices of the node, to see if there indeed is a match
    We can then visit all children of the node to report all matches

Aho-Corasick algorithm (https://cp-algorithms.com/string/aho_corasick.html)

    The Aho-Corasick algorithm constructs a data structure similar 
    to a trie with some additional links, and then constructs a finite state 
    machine (automaton) in O(mk) time, where k is the size of the used alphabet.


    Formally a trie is a rooted tree, where each edge of the tree is labeled by 
    some letter. All outgoing edge from one vertex mush have different labels.

    Consider any path in the trie from the root to any vertex. If we write out 
    the labels of all edges on the path, we get a string that corresponds to 
    this path. For any vertex in the trie we will associate the string 
    from the root to the vertex.

    Each vertex will also have a flag leaf which will be true, if any string 
    from the given set corresponds to this vertex.

    Accordingly to build a trie for a set of strings means to build a trie such 
    that each leaf vertex will correspond to one string from the set, and 
    conversely that each string of the set corresponds to one leaf vertex.

    We introduce a structure for the vertices of the tree.
    _______________________
    const int K = 26;

    struct Vertex {
        int next[K];
        bool leaf = false;

        Vertex() {
            fill(begin(next), end(next), -1);
        }
    };

    vector<Vertex> trie(1);
    _______________________
    To add strings to trie:
    Now we implement a function that will add a string s to the trie. 
    The implementation is extremely simple: we start at the root node, 
    and as long as there are edges corresponding to the characters of
    s we follow them. If there is no edge for one character, we simply 
    generate a new vertex and connect it via an edge. At the end of the 
    process we mark the last vertex with flag leaf.
    _______________________
    void add_string(string const& s) {
        int v = 0;
        for (char ch : s) {
            int c = ch - 'a';
            if (trie[v].next[c] == -1) {
                trie[v].next[c] = trie.size();
                trie.emplace_back(); // Default construction of the vector!
            }
            v = trie[v].next[c];
        }
        trie[v].leaf = true;
    }   
    _______________________
    The implementation obviously runs in linear time. And 
    since every vertex store k links, it will use O(mk) memory.

    It is possible to decrease the memory consumption to O(m) by using a 
    map instead of an array in each vertex. 
    However this will increase the complexity to O(nlogk).

    Construction of an automaton
    Suppose we have built a trie for the given set of strings. Now let's 
    look at it from a different side. If we look at any vertex. The string that 
    corresponds to it is a prefix of one or more strings in the set, thus 
    each vertex of the trie can be interpreted as a position in 
    one or more strings from the set.

    In fact the trie vertices can be interpreted as states in a finite deterministic 
    automaton. From any state we can transition - using some input letter - to 
    other states, i.e. to another position in the set of strings. For example, 
    if there is only one string in the trie abc, and we are standing at 
    vertex 2 (which corresponds to the string ab), then using the 
    letter c we can transition to the state 3.

    Thus we can understand the edges of the trie as transitions in an 
    automaton according to the corresponding letter. 
    However for an automaton we cannot restrict the possible transitions 
    for each state. If we try to perform a transition using a letter, 
    and there is no corresponding edge in the trie, then we 
    nevertheless must go into some state.

    More strictly, let us be in a state p corresponding to the string t, 
    and we want to transition to a different state with the character c.
    If there is an edge labeled with this letter c, then we can simply go 
    over this edge, and get the vertex corresponding to t+c. If there is no such edge, 
    then we must find the state corresponding to the longest proper suffix 
    of the string t (the longest available in the trie), and try to perform 
    a transition via c from there.

    For example let the trie be constructed by the strings ab and bc, 
    and we are currently at the vertex corresponding to ab, which 
    is a leaf. For a transition with the letter c, we are forced to go
    to the state corresponding to the string b, and from 
    there follow the edge with the letter c.

    A suffix link for a vertex p is a edge that points to the longest 
    proper suffix of the string corresponding to the vertex p. 
    The only special case is the root of the trie, the suffix 
    link will point to itself. Now we can reformulate the statement 
    about the transitions in the automaton like this: while from the 
    current vertex of the trie there is no transition using the current 
    letter (or until we reach the root), we follow the suffix link.

    Thus we reduced the problem of constructing an automaton to 
    the problem of finding suffix links for all vertices of the trie. 
    However we will build these suffix links, oddly enough, 
    using the transitions constructed in the automaton.

    Note that if we want to find a suffix link for some vertex v, 
    then we can go to the ancestor p of the current vertex 
    (let c be the letter of the edge from p to v), then follow its 
    suffix link, and perform from there the transition with the letter c.

    Thus the problem of finding the transitions has been reduced 
    to the problem of finding suffix links, and the problem of 
    finding suffix links has been reduced to the problem of finding 
    a suffix link and a transition, but for vertices closer to the root. 
    So we have a recursive dependence that we can resolve in linear time.

    Let's move to the implementation. Note that we now will store 
    the ancestor p and the character pch of the edge from p to v for 
    each vertex v. Also at each vertex we will store the suffix 
    link link (or −1 if it hasn't been calculated yet), and in the 
    array go[k] the transitions in the machine for each symbol 
    (again −1 if it hasn't been calculated yet).

    It is easy to see, that due to the memoization of the found suffix 
    links and transitions the total time for finding all suffix 
    links and transitions will be linear.

    Aho-Corasick Python Implementation: 
    (https://carshen.github.io/data-structures/algorithms/2014/04/07/aho-corasick-implementation-in-python.html)


    Implementation of the Aho-Corasick algorithm in Python
    07 Apr 2014

    Recall from last time that we needed to construct the trie, and then 
    set its failure transitions. After the trie is constructed, we traverse the 
    trie as we are reading in the input text and output the positions that 
    we find the keywords at. Essentially, these three parts form the structure of the algorithm.

    The trie is represented as an adjacency list. One row of the adjacency 
    list represents one node, and the index of the row is the unique id of that node. 
    The row contains a dict {'value':'', 'next_states':[],'fail_state':0,'output':[]}
    where value is the character the node represents ('a','b', '#', '$', etc), 
    next_states is a list of the id's of the child nodes, 
    fail_state is the id of the fail state, and output is a list of 
    all the complete keywords we have encountered so far as we have gone 
    through the input text (in this implementation, we can add the same word multiple times in the trie).

    We initialize the trie, called AdjList, and add the root 
    node. We have the keywords, which we will add one by one into the trie.

    1 from collections import deque
    2 AdjList = []
    3 
    4 def init_trie(keywords):
    5  """ creates a trie of keywords, then sets fail transitions """
    6  create_empty_trie()
    7  add_keywords(keywords)
    8  set_fail_transitions()
    9 
    10 def create_empty_trie():
    11  """ initalize the root of the trie """
    12  AdjList.append({'value':'', 'next_states':[],'fail_state':0,'output':[]})
    13 
    14 def add_keywords(keywords):
    15  """ add all keywords in list of keywords """
    16  for keyword in keywords:
    17      add_keyword(keyword)

    We also write a helper find_next_state which takes a node and a 
    value, and returns the id of the child of that node whose 
    value matches value, or else None if none found.

    1 def find_next_state(current_state, value):
    2   for node in AdjList[current_state]["next_states"]:
    3       if AdjList[node]["value"] == value:
    4           return node
    5   return None

    Note that this trie only handles lowercase words, for simplicity for my testing. 
    To add a keyword into the trie, we traverse the longest prefix of 
    the keyword that exists in the trie starting from the root, 
    then we add the characters of the rest of the keyword as nodes in the trie, in a chain.

    1 def add_keyword(keyword):
    2  """ add a keyword to the trie and mark output at the last node """
    3  current_state = 0
    4  j = 0
    5  keyword = keyword.lower()
    6  child = find_next_state(current_state, keyword[j])
    7  while child != None:
    8      current_state = child
    9      j = j + 1
    10      if j < len(keyword):
    11          child = find_next_state(current_state, keyword[j])
    12      else:
    13          break
    14  for i in range(j, len(keyword)):
    15      node = {'value':keyword[i],'next_states':[],'fail_state':0,'output':[]}
    16      AdjList.append(node)
    17      AdjList[current_state]["next_states"].append(len(AdjList) - 1)
    18      current_state = len(AdjList) - 1
    19  AdjList[current_state]["output"].append(keyword)

    The while loop finds the longest prefix of the keyword which exists in the 
    trie so far, and will exit when we can no longer match more characters 
    at index j. The for loop goes through the rest of the keyword, creating 
    a new node for each character and appending it to AdjList. len(AdjList) - 1 
    gives the id of the node we are appending, since we are adding to the end of AdjList.

    When we have completed adding the keyword in the trie, 
    AdjList[current_state]["output"].append(keyword) will append the 
    keyword to the output of the last node, to mark the end of the keyword at that node.

    Now, to set the fail transitions. We will do a breadth first search 
    over the trie and set the failure state of each node. First, we set 
    all the children of the root to have the failure state of the root, 
    since the longest strict suffix of a character would be the empty string, 
    represented by the root. The failure state of the root doesn't matter, 
    since when we get to the root, we will just leave the loop, 
    but we can just set it to be the root itself.

    Remember that the failure state indicates the end of 
    the next longest proper suffix of the string that we have currently matched.

    Consider the node r. We are setting the failure state for node child of r. 
    Initially the potential parent of the fail state of child, 
    state will be the next longest proper suffix, which is marked by r's fail state. 
    If there is no transition from r's fail state to a node with the same 
    value as child, then we go to the next longest proper suffix, 
    which is the fail state of r's fail state, and so on, until we 
    find one which works, or we are at the root. 
    We set child's fail state to be this fail state.

    We append the output of the fail state to child's output 
    because since the fail state is a suffix of the string which ends 
    at child, whatever matched words found at the fail state will also occur 
    at child. If we did not keep this line, we would miss 
    out on substrings of the currently matched string which are keywords.

    1 def set_fail_transitions():
    2  q = deque()
    3  child = 0
    4  for node in AdjList[0]["next_states"]:
    5      q.append(node)
    6      AdjList[node]["fail_state"] = 0
    7  while q:
    8      r = q.popleft()
    9      for child in AdjList[r]["next_states"]:
    10          q.append(child)
    11          state = AdjList[r]["fail_state"] # parents fail state
    12          while find_next_state(state, AdjList[child]["value"]) == None and state != 0:
    14              state = AdjList[state]["fail_state"]
    15          AdjList[child]["fail_state"] = find_next_state(state, AdjList[child]["value"])
    17          if AdjList[child]["fail_state"] is None:
    18              AdjList[child]["fail_state"] = 0
    19          AdjList[child]["output"] = AdjList[child]["output"] + AdjList[AdjList[child]["fail_state"]]["output"]

    Finally, our trie is constructed. Given an input, line, we iterate through each 
    character in line, going up to the fail state when we no longer match the next 
    character in line. At each node, we check to see if there is any output, and 
    we will capture all the outputted words and their respective indices. 
    (i-len(j) + 1 is for writing an index at the beginning of the word)

    1 def get_keywords_found(line):
    2  """ returns true if line contains any keywords in trie """
    3  line = line.lower()
    4  current_state = 0
    5  keywords_found = []
    6 
    7  for i in range(len(line)):
    8      while find_next_state(current_state, line[i]) is None and current_state != 0:
    9          current_state = AdjList[current_state]["fail_state"]
    10      current_state = find_next_state(current_state, line[i])
    11      if current_state is None:
    12          current_state = 0
    13      else:
    14          for j in AdjList[current_state]["output"]:
    15              keywords_found.append({"index":i-len(j) + 1,"word":j})
    16  return keywords_found
    Yay! We are done!

    Test it like so:

    1 init_trie(['cash', 'shew', 'ew'])
    2 print get_keywords_found("cashew")
    As always, leave questions and concerns in the comments below. See you next time!

Aho-Corasick APPLICATIONS:

    Applications

    Find all strings from a given set in a text
        Given a set of strings and a text. We have to print all occurrences of all strings 
        from the set in the given text in O(len+ans), where len is the 
        length of the text and ans is the size of the answer.

        We construct an automaton for this set of strings. We will now process the 
        text letter by letter, transitioning during the different states. Initially 
        we are at the root of the trie. If we are at any time at state v, and the 
        next letter is c, then we transition to the next state with go(v,c), thereby 
        either increasing the length of the current match substring by 1, 
        or decreasing it by following a suffix link.

        How can we find out for a state v, if there are any matches with strings for 
        the set? First, it is clear that if we stand on a leaf vertex, then 
        the string corresponding to the vertex ends at this position in the text. 
        However this is by no means the only possible case of achieving a match: 
        if we can reach one or more leaf vertices by moving along the suffix links, 
        then there will be also a match corresponding to each found leaf vertex. 
        A simple example demonstrating this situation can be creating using the 
        set of strings {dabce,abc,bc} and the text dabc.

        Thus if we store in each leaf vertex the index of the string corresponding 
        to it (or the list of indices if duplicate strings appear in the set), 
        then we can find in O(n) time the indices of all strings which match 
        the current state, by simply following the suffix links from the current 
        vertex to the root. However this is not the most efficient solution, 
        since this gives us O(n len) complexity in total. However this can 
        be optimized by computing and storing the nearest leaf vertex that 
        is reachable using suffix links (this is sometimes called the exit link). 
        This value we can compute lazily in linear time. Thus for 
        each vertex we can advance in O(1) time to the next marked 
        vertex in the suffix link path, i.e. to the next match. Thus for each 
        match we spend O(1) time, and therefore we reach the complexity O(len+ans).

        If you only want to count the occurrences and not find the indices themselves, 
        you can calculate the number of marked vertices in the suffix link path for each 
        vertex v. This can be calculated in O(n) time in total. Thus we can sum up all matches in O(len).

    Finding the lexicographical smallest string of a given length 
    that doesn't match any given strings
        A set of strings and a length L is given. We have to find a 
        string of length L, which does not contain any of the string, 
        and derive the lexicographical smallest of such strings.

        We can construct the automaton for the set of strings. Let's remember, 
        that the vertices from which we can reach a leaf vertex are the states, 
        at which we have a match with a string from the set. Since in this task 
        we have to avoid matches, we are not allowed to enter such states. 
        On the other hand we can enter all other vertices. Thus we delete all 
        "bad" vertices from the machine, and in the remaining graph of the automaton 
        we find the lexicographical smallest path of length L. This task can be solved 
        in O(L) for example by depth first search.

    Finding the shortest string containing all given strings
        Here we use the same ideas. For each vertex we store a mask that 
        denotes the strings which match at this state. Then the problem can 
        be reformulated as follows: initially being in the state (v=root, mask=0), 
        we want to reach the state (v, mask=(2^n − 1) ), where n is the number of strings 
        in the set. When we transition from one state to another using a letter, 
        we update the mask accordingly. By running a breath first search we 
        can find a path to the state (v, mask=2^n−1) with the smallest length.

    Finding the lexicographical smallest string of length L containing k strings
        As in the previous problem, we calculate for each vertex the number of 
        matches that correspond to it (that is the number of marked vertices 
        reachable using suffix links). We reformulate the problem: the current 
        state is determined by a triple of numbers (v, len, cnt), and we 
        want to reach from the state (root, 0, 0) the state (v, L, k), 
        where v can be any vertex. Thus we can find such a path using depth 
        first search (and if the search looks at the edges in their 
        natural order, then the found path will automatically 
        be the lexicographical smallest).

Z-algorithm easy explanation:
(https://cp-algorithms.com/string/z-function.html)

    Z-function and its calculation

    Suppose we are given a string s of length n. The Z-function for this string 
    is an array of length n where the i-th element is equal to the greatest 
    number of characters starting from the position i that 
    coincide with the first characters of s.

    In other words, z[i] is the length of the longest common prefix 
    between s and the suffix of s starting at i.

    Note. In this article, to avoid ambiguity, we assume 0-based indexes; 
    that is: the first character of s has index 0 and the last one has index n−1.

    The first element of Z-function, z[0], is generally not well defined. 
    In this article we will assume it is zero (although it doesn't 
    change anything in the algorithm implementation).

    This article presents an algorithm for calculating the Z-function 
    in O(n) time, as well as various of its applications.

    Examples
    For example, here are the values of the Z-function computed for different strings:

    "aaaaa" - [0,4,3,2,1]
    "aaabaab" - [0,2,1,0,2,1,0]
    "abacaba" - [0,0,1,0,3,0,1]

    Trivial algorithm
    Formal definition can be represented in the following elementary O(n2) implementation.

    vector<int> z_function_trivial(string s) {
        int n = (int) s.length();
        vector<int> z(n);
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i)
            while (i + z[i] < n && s[z[i]] == s[i + z[i]])
                ++z[i];
        return z;
    }

    We just iterate through every position i and update z[i] for each one of them, 
    starting from z[i]=0 and incrementing it as long as we don't find 
    a mismatch (and as long as we don't reach the end of the line).

    Of course, this is not an efficient implementation. We will 
    now show the construction of an efficient implementation.


Efficient algorithm to compute the Z-function
    To obtain an efficient algorithm we will compute the values of z[i] in 
    turn from i=1 to n−1 but at the same time, when computing a new value, 
    we'll try to make the best use possible of the previously computed values.

    For the sake of brevity, let's call segment matches those substrings that 
    coincide with a prefix of s. For example, the value of the desired 
    Z-function z[i] is the length of the segment match starting at 
    position i (and that ends at position i+z[i]−1).

    To do this, we will keep the [l,r] indices of the rightmost segment match. 
    That is, among all detected segments we will keep the one that ends 
    rightmost. In a way, the index r can be seen as the "boundary" to 
    which our string s has been scanned by the algorithm; 
    everything beyond that point is not yet known.

    Then, if the current index (for which we have to compute the next 
    value of the Z-function) is i, we have one of two options:

    i>r -- the current position is outside of what we have already processed.

    We will then compute z[i] with the trivial algorithm (that is, just comparing 
    values one by one). Note that in the end, if z[i]>0, we'll have to 
    update the indices of the rightmost segment, because it's 
    guaranteed that the new r=i+z[i]−1 is better than the previous r.

    i≤r -- the current position is inside the current segment match [l,r].

    Then we can use the already calculated Z-values to "initialize" the value 
    of z[i] to something (it sure is better than "starting from zero"), 
    maybe even some big number.

    For this, we observe that the substrings s[l…r] and s[0…r−l] match. 
    This means that as an initial approximation for z[i] we can take 
    the value already computed for the corresponding segment s[0…r−l], 
    and that is z[i−l].

    However, the value z[i−l] could be too large: when applied 
    to position i it could exceed the index r. This is not allowed 
    because we know nothing about the characters 
    to the right of r: they may differ from those required.

    Here is an example of a similar scenario:

    s="aaaabaa"
    When we get to the last position (i=6), the current match 
    segment will be [5,6]. Position 6 will then match position 6−5=1, 
    for which the value of the Z-function is z[1]=3. Obviously, we 
    cannot initialize z[6] to 3, it would be completely incorrect. 
    The maximum value we could initialize it to is 1 -- because it's the 
    largest value that doesn't bring us beyond the index r of the match segment [l,r].

    Thus, as an initial approximation for z[i] we can safely take:

    z0[i]=min(r−i+1,z[i−l])
    After having z[i] initialized to z0[i], we try to increment z[i] by 
    running the trivial algorithm -- because in general, after the border r, 
    we cannot know if the segment will continue to match or not.

    Thus, the whole algorithm is split in two cases, which differ only in 
    the initial value of z[i]: in the first case it's assumed to be zero, 
    in the second case it is determined by the previously computed 
    values (using the above formula). After that, both branches of this 
    algorithm can be reduced to the implementation of the trivial algorithm,
    which starts immediately after we specify the initial value.

    The algorithm turns out to be very simple. Despite the fact that on 
    each iteration the trivial algorithm is run, we have made significant 
    progress, having an algorithm that runs in linear time. Later on we will 
    prove that the running time is linear.

    Implementation
    Implementation turns out to be rather laconic:

    vector<int> z_function(string s) {
        int n = (int) s.length();
        vector<int> z(n);
        for (int i = 1, l = 0, r = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (i <= r)
                z[i] = min (r - i + 1, z[i - l]);
            while (i + z[i] < n && s[z[i]] == s[i + z[i]])
                ++z[i];
            if (i + z[i] - 1 > r)
                l = i, r = i + z[i] - 1;
        }
        return z;
    }

    Comments on this implementation
    The whole solution is given as a function which returns an array of length n -- the Z-function of s.

    Array z is initially filled with zeros. The current rightmost match segment 
    is assumed to be [0;0] (that is, a deliberately small segment which doesn't contain any i).

    Inside the loop for i=1…n−1 we first determine the initial value z[i] -- 
        it will either remain zero or be computed using the above formula.

    Thereafter, the trivial algorithm attempts to increase the value of z[i] as much as possible.

    In the end, if it's required (that is, if i+z[i]−1>r), we update the rightmost match segment [l,r].

z Algorithm Applications:
(https://cp-algorithms.com/string/z-function.html)

    Applications
    We will now consider some uses of Z-functions for specific tasks.

    These applications will be largely similar to applications of prefix function.

    Search the substring
    To avoid confusion, we call t the string of text, and p the pattern. 
    The problem is: find all occurrences of the pattern p inside the text t.

    To solve this problem, we create a new string s=p+⋄+t, that is, we apply 
    string concatenation to p and t but we also put a separator character ⋄ 
    in the middle (we'll choose ⋄ so that it will certainly not be 
    present anywhere in the strings p or t).

    Compute the Z-function for s. Then, for any i in the interval [0;length(t)−1], 
    we will consider the corresponding value k=z[i+length(p)+1]. If k is equal 
    to length(p) then we know there is one occurrence of p in the i-th position 
    of t, otherwise there is no occurrence of p in the i-th position of t.

    The running time (and memory consumption) is O(length(t)+length(p)).

    Number of distinct substrings in a string
    Given a string s of length n, count the number of distinct substrings of s.

    We'll solve this problem iteratively. That is: knowing the current 
    number of different substrings, recalculate this amount after adding to the end of s one character.

    So, let k be the current number of distinct substrings of s. We 
    append a new character c to s. Obviously, there can be some new 
    substrings ending in this new character c (namely, all those strings 
    that end with this symbol and that we haven't encountered yet).

    Take a string t=s+c and invert it (write its characters in reverse order). 
    Our task is now to count how many prefixes of t are not found anywhere else in t. 
    Let's compute the Z-function of t and find its maximum value zmax. Obviously, 
    t's prefix of length zmax occurs also somewhere in the middle of t. Clearly, 
    shorter prefixes also occur.

    So, we have found that the number of new substrings that appear when symbol c is
    appended to s is equal to length(t)−zmax.

    Consequently, the running time of this solution is O(n2) for a string of length n.

    It's worth noting that in exactly the same way we can recalculate, still in 
    O(n) time, the number of distinct substrings when appending a character in the 
    beginning of the string, as well as when removing it (from the end or the beginning).

    String compression
    Given a string s of length n. Find its shortest "compressed" representation, 
    that is: find a string t of shortest length such that s can be represented 
    as a concatenation of one or more copies of t.

    A solution is: compute the Z-function of s, loop through all i such that i 
    divides n. Stop at the first i such that i+z[i]=n. Then, the string s 
    can be compressed to the length i.

    The proof for this fact is the same as the solution which uses the prefix function.

Z algorithm (https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/string-algorithm/z-algorithm/tutorial/)

COOL NOTES: Z ALGORITHM FOR STRINGS:


    The Z-function for a string S of length N is an array of length N 
    where the i th element is equal to the greatest number of 
    characters starting from the position i 
    that coincide with the first characters of S.

    In other words, z[i] is the length 
    of the longest common prefix between S 
    and the suffix of S starting at i. We assume 0-based indexes; 
    that is, the first character of S has index 0 and the last one has index N-1.

    The first element of Z-functions, z[0], is generally not 
    well-defined. In this article we will assume it is zero.

    z [ 0 ] = 0

    This article presents an algorithm for calculating the Z-function 
    in O(N) time, as well as various of its applications.


    Examples

    For example, here are the values of the Z-function computed for different strings:

    s = 'aaaaa'
    Z[0]	Z[1]	Z[2]	Z[3]	Z[4]
    0	      4	      3	      2	      1

    s = 'aaabaab'
    Z[0]	Z[1]	Z[2]	Z[3]	Z[4]	Z[5]	Z[6]
    0	      2	      1	      0	      2	      1	      0

    s = 'abacaba'
    Z[0]	Z[1]	Z[2]	Z[3]	Z[4]	Z[5]	Z[6]
    0	      0	      1	      0	      3       0	      1

    Trivial algorithm

    The formal definition can be represented in the following elementary implementation.

    vector<int> z_function_trivial(string s) 
    {
        int n = (int) s.length();
        vector<int> z(n);
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i)
            while (i + z[i] < n && s[z[i]] == s[i + z[i]])
                ++z[i];
        return z;
    }

    We just iterate through every position and update for each one of them, 
    starting from and incrementing it as long as we do not 
    find a mismatch (and as long as we do not reach the end of the line).

    Efficient algorithm

    The idea is to maintain an interval [L, R] which is the interval with max R
    such that [L,R] is prefix substring (substring which is also prefix). 

    Steps for maintaining this interval are as follows – 

    1) If i > R then there is no prefix substring that starts before i and 
    ends after i, so we reset L and R and compute new [L,R] by comparing 
    str[0..] to str[i..] and get Z[i] (= R-L+1).

    2) If i <= R then let K = i-L,  now Z[i] >= min(Z[K], R-i+1)  because 
    str[i..] matches with str[K..] for atleast R-i+1 characters (they are in
    [L,R] interval which we know is a prefix substring).     
    Now two sub cases arise – 
        a) If Z[K] < R-i+1  then there is no prefix substring starting at 
            str[i] (otherwise Z[K] would be larger)  so  Z[i] = Z[K]  and 
            interval [L,R] remains same.
        b) If Z[K] >= R-i+1 then it is possible to extend the [L,R] interval
            thus we will set L as i and start matching from str[R]  onwards  and
            get new R then we will update interval [L,R] and calculate Z[i] (=R-L+1).

            
    Implementation
    // returns array z[] where z[i] is z-function of s[i]
    int[] zFucntion(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        int z[] = new int[n];
        int R = 0;
        int L = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            z[i] = 0;
            if (R > i) {
                z[i] = Math.min(R - i, z[i - L]);
            }
            while (i + z[i] < n && s.charAt(i+z[i]) == s.charAt(z[i])) {
                z[i]++;
            }
            if (i + z[i] > R) {
                L = i;
                R = i + z[i];
            }
        }
        z[0] = n;
        return z;
    }
