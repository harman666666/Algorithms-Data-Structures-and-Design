There is a table courses with columns: student and class

Please list out all classes which have more than or equal to 5 students.

For example, the table:

+---------+------------+
| student | class      |
+---------+------------+
| A       | Math       |
| B       | English    |
| C       | Math       |
| D       | Biology    |
| E       | Math       |
| F       | Computer   |
| G       | Math       |
| H       | Math       |
| I       | Math       |
+---------+------------+
Should output:

+---------+
| class   |
+---------+
| Math    |
+---------+
Note:
The students should not be counted duplicate in each course.


my solution///////////
SELECT class from (SELECT DISTINCT student, class from courses) as result
GROUP BY result.class
HAVING COUNT(class) >= 5
/////////////////////////
FASTER:
SELECT
    class
FROM
    (SELECT
        class, COUNT(DISTINCT student) AS num
    FROM
        courses
    GROUP BY class) AS temp_table
WHERE
    num >= 5
;

Approach: Using GROUP BY and HAVING condition [Accepted]

Algorithm

Using sub-query is one way to add some condition to a GROUP BY clause, however, using HAVING is another simpler and natural approach. So we can rewrite the above solution as below.

MySQL

SELECT
    class
FROM
    courses
GROUP BY class
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT student) >= 5
;
