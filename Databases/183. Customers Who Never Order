Suppose that a website contains two tables, the Customers
table and the Orders table. Write a SQL query to find all customers
who never order anything.

Table: Customers.

+----+-------+
| Id | Name  |
+----+-------+
| 1  | Joe   |
| 2  | Henry |
| 3  | Sam   |
| 4  | Max   |
+----+-------+
Table: Orders.

+----+------------+
| Id | CustomerId |
+----+------------+
| 1  | 3          |
| 2  | 1          |
+----+------------+
Using the above tables as example, return the following:

+-----------+
| Customers |
+-----------+
| Henry     |
| Max       |
+-----------+

SELECT Name as Customers FROM Customers
WHERE Customers.Id not IN
(
SELECT CUSTOMERS.Id as Customers FROM CUSTOMERS
INNER JOIN ORDERS
ON ORDERS.CustomerId = CUSTOMERS .Id
)
;

# Write your MySQL query statement below

SELECT Name as Customers from Customers
Left Join Orders on Orders.CustomerId = Customers.Id
Where Orders.CustomerId is Null;
