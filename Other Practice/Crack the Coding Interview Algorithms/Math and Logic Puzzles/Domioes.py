You have an 8x8 chessboard in which 2 diagonally opposite corners have been cut off.
You are given 31 dominos and a single domino can cover exactly 2 squares. Can you use the 31 dominoes to cover the
entire board? Prove your answer (by providing an example or showing it is impossible)

8x8 - 1 - 1 = 62 squares
31 x 2 = 62 squares
Yes there are enuff squares to cover so now think geometrically.
