(*
the simplest solution would be to use one stack as the head of the dequeue, and one as the tail. 
The endequeue operations would just be a push to the respective stack, and the dedequeue 
operations would just be a pop on the respective stack.

However, if the stack you want to dedequeue from is empty, you'd have to pop each element from the 
other stack and push it back to the stack you want to dedequeue from, and then dedequeue the last one. 
That's not really good performance, so the overall performance of this implementation strongly
 depends on the workload. If your workload is a balanced number of front/back endequeue and dedequeue operations, 
 then this will be really really fast. But if your workload consists of a lot of alternating head-dedequeues
  and tail-dedequeues while the dequeue is large, then this will obviously be a bad approach.
