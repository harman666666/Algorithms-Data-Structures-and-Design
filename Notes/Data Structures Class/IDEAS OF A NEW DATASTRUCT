Basically thsi new datastruct.
Inserts (k, v) pairs into a map

The map is implemented like a treap and an array of linked lists.

The k is hashed and turned into something usable.


Maybe its an array of skip lists.
Or a skip list of lists

and ...

Randomization is used to build the skip list based on the keys USED AS A SEED INTO A RANDOM NUMBER GENERATOR THAT
GENERATES A SPECIFIC TYPE OF SEQUENCE FOR EACH HASHED KEY...

THINK ABOUT THIS MORE BUT IT SEEMS REALELY COOL EVEN IF IT DOESNT WORK OUT.

Call it Skip Maps, Treap Map, or Something like that.
