This is the key highlights of what is expected for the Machine Learning Design interview:

You should be able to describe the components of an end-to-end ML system, including but not
limited to; model development, evaluation, and deployment.

You should be able to use existing toolsets to model the problem and break down its
components.

Be ready to analyze your approach while understanding the tradeoffs between your design
decisions.

We expect you to have a good understanding of common ML tools/techniques, but we do not
expect you to know and memorize every ML algorithm out there.
