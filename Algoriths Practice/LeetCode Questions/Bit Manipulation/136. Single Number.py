'''
Given an array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

Note:
Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

Solution

Approach #1 List operation [Time Limit Exceeded]

Algorithm

Iterate over all the elements in \text{nums}nums
If some number in \text{nums}nums is new to array, append it
If some number is already in the array, remove it
Python

class Solution(object):
    def singleNumber(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        no_duplicate_list = []
        for i in nums:
            if i not in no_duplicate_list:
                no_duplicate_list.append(i)
            else:
                no_duplicate_list.remove(i)
        return no_duplicate_list.pop()
Complexity Analysis

Time complexity : O(n^2)O(n
​2
​​ ). We iterate through \text{nums}nums, taking O(n)O(n) time. We search the whole list to find whether there is duplicate number, taking O(n)O(n) time. Because search is in the for loop, so we have to multiply both time complexities which is O(n^2)O(n
​2
​​ ).

Space complexity : O(n)O(n). We need a list of size nn to contain elements in \text{nums}nums.

Approach #2 Hash Table [Accepted]

Algorithm

We use hash table to avoid the O(n) time required for searching the elements.

Iterate through all elements in \text{nums}nums
Try if hash\_tablehash_table has the key for pop
If not, set up key/value pair
In the end, there is only one element in hash\_tablehash_table, so use popitem to get it
Python

class Solution(object):
    def singleNumber(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        hash_table = {}
        for i in nums:
            try:
                hash_table.pop(i)
            except:
                hash_table[i] = 1
        return hash_table.popitem()[0]
Complexity Analysis

Time complexity : O(n * 1) = O(n)O(n∗1)=O(n). Time complexity of for loop is O(n)O(n). Time complexity of hash table(dictionary in python) operation pop is O(1)O(1).

Space complexity : O(n)O(n). The space required by hash\_tablehash_table is equal to the number of elements in \text{nums}nums.

Approach #3 Math [Accepted]

Concept

2 * (a + b + c) - (a + a + b + b + c) = c2∗(a+b+c)−(a+a+b+b+c)=c

Python

class Solution(object):
    def singleNumber(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        return 2 * sum(set(nums)) - sum(nums)
Complexity Analysis

Time complexity : O(n + n) = O(n)O(n+n)=O(n). sum will call next to iterate through \text{nums}nums. We can see it as sum(list(i, for i in nums)) which means the time complexity is O(n)O(n) because of the number of elements(nn) in \text{nums}nums.

Space complexity : O(n + n) = O(n)O(n+n)=O(n). set needs space for the elements in nums

Approach #4 Bit Manipulation [Accepted]

Concept

If we take XOR of zero and some bit, it will return that bit

If we take XOR of two same bits, it will return 0

So we can XOR all bits together to find the unique number.

Python

class Solution(object):
    def singleNumber(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        a = 0
        for i in nums:
            a ^= i
        return a
Complexity Analysis

Time complexity : O(n). We only iterate through \text{nums}nums, so the time complexity is the number of elements in \text{nums}nums.

Space complexity : O(1).
