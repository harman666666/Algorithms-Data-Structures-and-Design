'''
Given n pairs of parentheses, write a function to generate all combinations of well-formed parentheses.

For example, given n = 3, a solution set is:

[
  "((()))",
  "(()())",
  "(())()",
  "()(())",
  "()()()"
]

ENUMERATIONS AND CLOSURE NUMBER SOLUTION:
Intuition

To enumerate something, generally we would like to express 
it as a sum of disjoint subsets that are easier to count.

Consider the closure number of a valid parentheses sequence S: 
the least index >= 0 so that S[0], S[1], ..., S[2*index+1] is valid. 
Clearly, every parentheses sequence has a unique closure number. We can try to enumerate them individually.

Algorithm

For each closure number c, we know the starting and ending brackets must be at index 0 and 2*c + 1. 
Then, the 2*c elements between must be a valid sequence, plus the rest of the elements must be a valid sequence.
