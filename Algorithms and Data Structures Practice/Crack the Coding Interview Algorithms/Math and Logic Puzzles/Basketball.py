You have a basketball and someone says that you can play one of 2 games.
Game 1: You get one shot to make the hoop
Game 2: You get three shots and you have to make 2 of the 3 shots.

If p is the probability to making a particular shot, for which values of p should you pick one game or the other.

Game 1. Probability -> p
Game 2. Prob -> 3 choose 2 * p^2 = 3p^2

p = 3p^2 -> 1/3 = p.


When to pick game 1 -> p > 3p^2 -> 1/3 > p

For p == 1/3 can pick either wont matter

pick game 2 when p > 1/3

so p = 1/2
then Game 1 -> 1/2
Game 2-> 3 * 1/4 -> 3/4
