'''
You have 2 ropes and each takes exactly one hour to burn. How would you use them to time exactly 15 minutes?
Note that the ropes are of uneven densities, so half the rope length-wise does not necessarily take half an hour to burn.

One rope has lenght x
Other rope has length y
Total length = x + y = 2 hours

Cut x in half -> x1 + x2 = 1 hour


Cut y in half -> y1 + y2 = 1 hour


x1 + x2 + y1 + y2 = 2 hour


x1 + x2 = y1 + y2

Light both ends of rope1 and one end of rope2.
When rope2 done buring, 30 mins have passed and rope2 is half done.
Then burn the other end of rope2, and once rope2 is done, 15 mins have passed.
