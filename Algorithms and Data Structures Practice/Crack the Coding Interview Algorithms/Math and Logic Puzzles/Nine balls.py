You have 9 balls, 8 are the same weight and one is heavier. You are given a balance which tells you only whther the
left side or the right side is havier. Find the heavy ball in just 2 uses of the scale.

Put 3 balls on one side and 3 balls on the other side and leave out 3 balls.
Same weight then the 3 balls left out contain heavy ball.
otherwise the 3 balls that are heavier contain the heavy ball.


Repeat process for 3 balls with one heavy.

weigh 2. and leave out one. If they are equal weight then ball left out is heavy.
Otherwise the scale will indicate the heavy ball.
