'''Given 2 straight line segments (represented as a start point and end point)
compute the point of intersection (or point of line segment intersection) if any
'''

import math
from point import Point, length
from line import Line

'''
y1 = m1x + b1
(y1 - b1)/m1 = x


y2 = m2x + b2
(y2-b2)/m2 = x


m1x + b1 = m2x + b2
(m1 - m2)x = b2 - b1
x = (b2 - b1)/(m1 - m2)
Then to get y, evaluate it.

They can intersect if they are the same sloped line and they are on each other 
or they are dif lines and intersect
