'''
Given 2 arrays of integers, compute the pair of values, one value in each array,
with the smallest(non-negative) difference. Return the difference
'''

arr1 = [1,3,15,11,2]
arr2 = [23,127,235,19,8]

arr3 = [11,1,5,6,1,3,4,7,9,5,2]
arr4 = [6,3,7,3,8,9,12,4,67,5]

'''
The smallest diff is between adjacent numbers in the merged list of the 2 arrays
[1,2,3,8,11,15,19,23,127,235]
[A,A,A,B,A,A,B,B,B,B]

Algo performance O(nlogn)

The simpler algo which was not implemented here was moving up the 
ptr for the array with the smaller array value by 1. Therefore
getting closer to minimizing the difference.
