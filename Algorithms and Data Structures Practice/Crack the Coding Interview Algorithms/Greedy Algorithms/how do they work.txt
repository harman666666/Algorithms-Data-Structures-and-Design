Greedy algos work by using simple and/or local rules to make decisions and
commit on them (anology -> making profit in short term)

Multiple natural greedy strategies for the interval scheduling such as:
Make decisions based on
Earliest Starting Time
Earliest Finishing Time
Shortest Interval
Minimum Conflicts

Pick the best strategy(using intuition and algorithmic sense), which in this case is Earliest Finishing Time
You could argue that the other three strategies are bad.

Now that you know what that best strategy is, you have to argue its the best

You have to argue that any optimal solution will do no worse by
using the interval with earliest finishing time
