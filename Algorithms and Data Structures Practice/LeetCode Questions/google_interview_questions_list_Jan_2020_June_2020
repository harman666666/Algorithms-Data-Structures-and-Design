Agreed to Google search:
"In order to show you the most relevant results, we have omitted some entries very similar to the 100 already displayed.
If you like, you can repeat the search with the omitted results included."
Why did I prepare this list?
My stats are below
275/1376 Solved (last 200 in last 1 & 1/2 month)
Easy 190, Medium 85, Hard 0
Profile: https://leetcode.com/pgmreddy/
Currently solving with JavaScript, previously experience is with C++14
Still solving questions easily, submissions only fail due to external disturbance.
Felt it's time to pause doing those same string/array questions, and up the game, did a lot tree problems, but need to do a lot of graph problems soon, do Google interview questions too. Felt count is important, but breadth is important.
Employement status: Unemployed, fulltime (trying) solving on LeetCode (May be, for next 1 & 1/2 months more)
Failed Google & Facebook in March 2020
Failing both companies, since year 2016 :) (Coz, no leetcode, etc. fully focused on work for the company I join, but now got bored of failing)
LeetCode premium is a bit costly, but is worth it as per others. But what if I stop doing LeetCode from tomorrow scenario, and don't come back for a year or more, due to a lucrative gig?
Goal: Solve 500 problems asap including some Google questions, before next gig starts. Not looking for a job for a month :). Each 50 more problems solved => Double the problem solving speed.
