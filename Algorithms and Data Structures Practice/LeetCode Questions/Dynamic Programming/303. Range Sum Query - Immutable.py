'''
Given an integer array nums, find the sum of the elements between indices i and j (i â‰¤ j), inclusive.

Example:
Given nums = [-2, 0, 3, -5, 2, -1]

sumRange(0, 2) -> 1
sumRange(2, 5) -> -1
sumRange(0, 5) -> -3
Note:
You may assume that the array does not change.
There are many calls to sumRange function.

Would you need a 2D map


NNOOOOO ITS EASY JUST ST]
OE [APT]
IONAL SUMS.

    Save intervals in the map,
    and if a sum requires that interval, then do that + extra computation from there

    Map works like this:

    recursively call sumRange and lookups in map for intervals that exist

    map[start][end] -> Gives one range
    if start doesnt exist, try to do a lookup with startVal + sumrange(start + 1, end)
     (this will recursively check if that value is in the map)
    requires O(n^2) space probably
