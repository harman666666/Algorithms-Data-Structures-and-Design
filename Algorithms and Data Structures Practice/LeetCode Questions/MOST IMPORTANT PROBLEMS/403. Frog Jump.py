A frog is crossing a river. The river is divided 
into x units and at each unit there may or may not exist 
a stone. The frog can jump on a stone, but it must not jump into the water.

Given a list of stones' positions (in units) in sorted 
ascending order, determine if the frog is able to cross the 
river by landing on the last stone. Initially, the frog is on
the first stone and assume the first jump must be 1 unit.

If the frog's last jump was k units, then its next jump must be 
either k - 1, k, or k + 1 units. Note that the frog can only jump 
in the forward direction.

Note:

The number of stones is â‰¥ 2 and is < 1,100.
Each stone's position will be a non-negative integer < 231.
The first stone's position is always 0.
Example 1:

[0,1,3,5,6,8,12,17]

There are a total of 8 stones.
The first stone at the 0th unit, second stone at the 1st unit,
third stone at the 3rd unit, and so on...
The last stone at the 17th unit.

Return true. The frog can jump to the last stone by jumping 
1 unit to the 2nd stone, then 2 units to the 3rd stone, then 
2 units to the 4th stone, then 3 units to the 6th stone, 
4 units to the 7th stone, and 5 units to the 8th stone.
Example 2:

[0,1,2,3,4,8,9,11]

Return false. There is no way to jump to the last stone as 
the gap between the 5th and 6th stone is too large.

class Solution:
    '''
    In this case, 
    Recursive DP is the same as traversing a graph with DFS using a visited set.
    Please memorize this relationship.
    
    Visited set -> is the DP array for dfs, which allows us to optimize to linear time from factorial time.
    
    When you do a DP question -> think about GRAPH traversal as a possible means to a solution as well
    because its the same thing essentially.
