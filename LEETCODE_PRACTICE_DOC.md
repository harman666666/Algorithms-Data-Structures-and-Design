My approach for solving system design in an interview:

Functional Requirements / Use Cases - Spend max of 5 mins here. (Note: not asking questions is red flag)
Non-Functional Requirements/NFR (scalability, latency, CAP, durability etc)- 2 minutes
Back of the envelope (capacity) estimations - Spend max of 2-5 mins.
Generic High Level Design (HLD)-- covering in-flow and outflow of data -- 5-10 mins
Data Model / APIs (as applicable) - 5 mins
Scale each component in HLD depending on NFR - 10 mins
Verify your design / Discuss trade-offs of your design with interviewer (important) - 5 mins
Make your own notes on below items which you can refer to the day before each interview as a quick reference.

Your programming language - important data structure methods
Math formulas - eg: GCD, area, euclidean distance between points etc..

latency numbers every programmer needs to know
