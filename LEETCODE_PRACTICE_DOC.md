Hard dps that are supposeedly easy:

Here I will be updating the list of DP Hard problems which are actually easy. The only difficult part is that we are not able to think in the correct direction. And that's the trickiest part with DP problems -
not able to come up with recurrence relation

Hi All,

I just completed my DP adventure which I started in last June and I would like to share my findings in this post.
There are total 241 dp tagged problems in LeetCode as of Today, and 26 of them are locked so I only solved the public ones.

First of all, I participated the monthly challange April & May, so this really helped me to build a habbit of daily problem solving
Then I started to solve DP problems and kept updating my monthly problem list here.
https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/665187/everyday-dp-challenge-list
The average pace was about 1 problem per day.
I read these great articles to learn the general dynamic programming knowledge & patterns
https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/458695/Dynamic-Programming-Patterns
https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/662866/DP-for-Beginners-Problems-or-Patterns-or-Sample-Solutions
