Record knowledge for 88. Merge Sorted Array


PLEASE TAKE NOTES ON THE SOLUTIONS OF find median from datastream. 


TAKES NOTES ON 73.  SET MATRIX ZEROS. 

For generate parenthesis can you do DP? GET NOTES FOR THIS. 


RESAARCH RESULTS FOR 33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array 
        
        -> write notes on how you got the solution!
        Wrote down the rules.
        Write down the big rules that satisfy the world constraints
        then write down the local constraints for that world
        the way you write the if statements matters!
        An if statement should seperate worlds aka 
        the sorted world vs unsorted pivot world

        -> Also try DOING a circular array using mod! and finding the pivot!
        -> getting key things like the pivot make the problem easier!
        soemtimes easier to break the problem up and do it that way.

Fix all topolical sort -> the error is you are assuming that you can fill the visited set with the nodes of the first 
path in all paths but actually each path in all paths can be different, so you have to deal with at the individual level.
