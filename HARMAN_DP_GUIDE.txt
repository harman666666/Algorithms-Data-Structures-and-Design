Cutting a Rod | DP-13
Given a rod of length n inches and an array of prices that contains prices 
of all pieces of size smaller than n. Determine the maximum value obtainable 
by cutting up the rod and selling the pieces. For example, if length of the rod 
is 8 and the values of different pieces are given as following, then the maximum 
obtainable value is 22 (by cutting in two pieces of lengths 2 and 6)


length   | 1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8  
--------------------------------------------
price    | 1   5   8   9  10  17  17  20
And if the prices are as following, then the maximum obtainable value is 24 (by cutting in eight pieces of length 1)

length   | 1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8  
--------------------------------------------
price    | 3   5   8   9  10  17  17  20

Determin the max value you get from rod of size 1, rod of size 2  up to rod of size n. 

Backward DP: 


Forward DP: 

From state 0 -> go to state 1, relax, if you get a better value.
